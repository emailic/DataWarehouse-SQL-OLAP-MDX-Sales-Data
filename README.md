# DataWarehouseSQL
This project was done at the University of Pisa in collaboration with my colleagues Federica Guiducci and Valentina Olivotto under supervision of professors Anna Monreale and Roberto Pellungrini. It is a Data Warehousing project featuring the use of Analytic SQL and various other tools such as Visual Studio in MS Azure, Microstrategy and Power BI.
